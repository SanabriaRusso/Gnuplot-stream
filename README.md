# Gnuplot-stream
Plotting a live-stream of data using feedgnuplot.

This directory contains an example of how to use the feedgnuplot pipelining plot tool.

From the repository I understand that is just simply:
	1. Generates a stream of data, which is pipelined to...
	2. feedgnuplot tool.

Other parameters are available.

This directory should give you all you need to know to start playing with the aforementioned tool. BTW, the github repository contains very useful information and recipes.
